# Chat

There are two Discord servers to find Airframes related discussions and resources. The first is the official Airframes Discord, and the second is an older but still relevant Discord where we first started.

## Official Airframes Discord

The official [Airframes Discord](https://discord.gg/airframes) is at https://discord.gg/airframes. Please come be a part of the feeder community, get technical support, follow our development progress, or just come say hello!

## Airplanes.Live Discord (previously the ADSBExchange Discord)

The Airframes community is on the [Airplanes.Live Discord](https://discord.gg/aXt7KdycJk). This was previously named as the ADSBExchange Discord. We encourage you to come participate in the development or get your questions answered. While Airframes does not ingest ADS-B, we are huge fans, and we continually support and encourage others to help all of the ADS-B services to expand their coverage. Many of them will be our partners at some point, so please consider it.
